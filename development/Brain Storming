# The actual programming:
1) The path
	- Just a simple function to draw the path
	- A class with movement algorithms for each enemy
	
2) Towers
	- A super class for all the towers, then sub classes for each individual kind of tower
		- Contain details regarding their damage, building them, upgrades + cost, 

3) Enemies
	- A super class for the enemies, then sub classes for each type of enemy
		- Contain details regarding health bar(floating on top), their damage to player health, their size, 
		  their movement speed, gold reward
	- Check for when an enemy is killed and update the money variable.
		
4) Other random features
	- Health and currency just stored in a variable
		- Displayed at the top, and whenever there is an update to the variable, update the graphic displaying the values
	- Functions for the individual powerups/abilities

5) Multiple levels and menus and crap
	- Create a variable for if level is finished, or a function to test, maybe just in the update player health area
	- Levels that come in waves(?)
	- Levels have functions to draw them
	- Variable containing what level it is, so movement algorithms, enemy spawns and tower upgrades are checked from there
